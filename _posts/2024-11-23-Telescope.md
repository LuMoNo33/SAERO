As part of an optics class project, we built a refractor telescope capable of magnifying images by at least 40x. Using easily accessible materials and leveraging 3D design and printing, we successfully constructed a telescope that was both aesthetically pleasing and fully functional. Our team achieved the best results while spending the least amount of money compared to others.

The presentation and accompanying document showcase the results of this work.

As future improvements, we plan to incorporate a variable diaphragm to adjust the aperture. This will enhance image sharpness and reduce chromatic aberrations by closing the aperture when necessary, while allowing it to open in low-light conditions where chromatic aberration is less significant for the user. Additionally, we aim to integrate servomotors for greater precision and remote control of the telescope.
