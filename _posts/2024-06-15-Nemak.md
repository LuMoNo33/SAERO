As this internship took place within a private company, I cannot fully disclose the specifics of the work conducted inside the plant. However, I will highlight the key activities and learnings gained during my time at Nemak, a leading automotive enterprise specializing in the manufacturing of aluminum components. Their products include engine heads, engine blocks, car frames, and more, with a strong focus on the casting process of liquid aluminum

I was selected from over 300 applicants as one of 15 participants in the Engenius 5-week program. In this program, we work in teams of three to develop a project that provides significant value to the company, whether in areas such as economics, quality, delivery, or other strategic advantages.

My team and I decided to focus on safety, specifically addressing newly acquired core racks designed to move the heavy cores required for casting engine heads and blocks, known as galleries. These racks are equipped with tires to allow manual operation and movement, reducing the reliance on forklifts. However, they could not be implemented because the existing rotating tables were not compatible with these devices.

*Gallery and core rack example*

During the first week, we focused on idea generation. We explored various concepts that could hold the new racks, including different elevator mechanisms, such as the one used in the Audi Museum in Ingolstadt, as well as carousel-type systems.

We decided to adapt the existing rotating tables to make them safe for use with the new core racks. During this step, we considered various attachment methods, such as electromagnets, claws, or locking mechanisms. Ultimately, after evaluating the business's needs and priorities, we chose to implement passive mechanical supports to securely hold the racks in place.

With this clear objective, we began designing and conducting stress tests, along with other necessary evaluations. Once the design phase was complete, we moved on to prototyping. With the support of plant technicians, we obtained an unused rotating table to apply our modifications. We welded the supports and performed preliminary tests:

  </tr>
</table>
*Prototype development*

Once the supports were added, we mounted the new core racks onto the rotating table using a forklift. After clearing the area, we increased the rotating table's velocity to levels beyond the standard operating limits used in the plant. This allowed us to observe its behavior under unexpected conditions. Additionally, we conducted tests with the racks improperly positioned to assess its performance in suboptimal scenarios. The rotating table successfully held the core racks in place during all tests.

*Test with Core Racks*

We observed that operators often rotated the table while it was in its lowest position—a practice that could be dangerous as the safety guards might collide with the rack, causing instability and creating a hazardous situation.
To address this issue, we proposed adding pneumatic stops to hold the rotating table in place until it has cleared the safety guards.

However, we discovered that limit switches were already installed in the plant but had not been used for many years. We decided to repurpose these switches to disable the rotate button until the elevator on the rotating table was raised beyond the safety guards. With this final modification, we successfully completed our prototype within three of the five weeks of the program.

*Finished Prototype*

After painting our prototype, we contacted the plant’s safety department to conduct all the necessary inspections for implementing our prototype into operations. Following extensive paperwork, we successfully replaced a damaged rotating table with our new prototype, allowing operations to proceed with the new core racks.


Since the new racks could be moved manually by operators, the number of forklifts required was reduced. If implemented across the entire plant, forklifts would only be needed to load the core racks. This reduction in forklifts contributed to a safer working environment and a yearly decrease in CO₂ emissions.

*2nd Place at Engenius Program*

We presented our project to the CEO and all plant managers. In the end, our team’s project was awarded 2nd place within the entire program. Additionally, feedback from friends and employees at Nemak indicates that our solution has been implemented across the entire plant.
