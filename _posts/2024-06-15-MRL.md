As part of the student group MRL (Monterrey Rocket Lab), we design, manufacture, and launch rockets powered by our own SRAD (Student-Researched and Developed) motors. 

Last semester (Aug–Dec 2024), as the leader of the propulsion sub-team, I was responsible for mentoring new members in the design and development of their own KNSB rocket motors. A preview of the manufacturing process is shown below:

However, we typically use a higher-performance propellant composed of Ammonium Nitrate and aluminum powder for competitions.
The following paper highlights the manufacturing process of the Ammonium Nitrate composite propellant L1101 motor:

We previously competed at Latin American Space Challenge (LASC) in Brazil in 2023, as well as at ENMICE (Encuentro Mexicano de Cohetería Experimental) in 2022 and 2024.

*MRL at ENMICE 2024*

This year we are preparing to compete at ENMICE  in Dec 2025 and at IREC International (International Rocket Engineering Competition) in Jun 2025 flying our 10,000 ft apogee *Paragon* Rocket.

We are currently developing a new high-performance propellant formulation using Ammonium Nitrate (AN) and Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) as the main ingredients. This formulation aims to eliminate the compression step, simplify the propellant casting process and streamline motor manufacturing.

This semester, the propulsion team will focus on creating low-smoke non-toxic propellants that can easily have their plume characteristics modified by adding different catalysts. This approach will enable us to design new propellants efficiently and, in the future, sell motors affordably to beginner Mexican experimental rocketry teams as a way to introduce them to competitions.

The objective is to thoroughly test these new propellants and fully characterize their properties, including ease of manufacture, burn rate, dependencies on pressure and temperature, hygroscopicity, and more. If all goes well, we aim to use one of these new propellants in the International Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) 2025 to launch our Paragon rocket.

We are constantly striving to develop new skills and create high-performance rockets that challenge us, all while prioritizing the safety of both people and facilities.

As part of an advanced project for the most skilled members of the propulsion team, we are researching and developing a liquid rocket engine. We are actively seeking sponsors and are currently in negotiations with Tecmaq, a Mexican company specializing in CNC manufacturing, to produce precision parts such as the combustion chamber.
