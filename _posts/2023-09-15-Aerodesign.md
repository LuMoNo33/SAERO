As part of the SAE Aero Design team, I took on the critical responsibility of wing optimization, focusing on maximizing aerodynamic performance and ensuring the structural integrity of the aircraft. This role required a deep understanding of fluid dynamics, airfoil selection, and load analysis, as well as close collaboration with team members to integrate the wing design seamlessly into the overall aircraft.

The report linked below (in Spanish) provides detailed insights into the aircraft we built for the SAE Aero Design 2024 competition, showcasing the technical innovation and teamwork that went into the project:
