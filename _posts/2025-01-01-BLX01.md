As part of one of the Aerospace Society (SAERO) initiatives, we are working in a research project to present in congresses. Currently, we are working to present an abstract as a group to the IAC 2025 in Sydney.

The plan is to design and develop an aircraft powered by electrohydrodynamic (EHD) propulsion. This aircraft will not use a propeller or any moving parts to generate thrust. Instead, it relies on electrodes exposed to high voltage to ionize the air near the emitter (a thin wire). The positively charged air ions are accelerated toward the collector (a large, thin airfoil), and in the process, they push neutral air, generating silent thrust.

For this purpose, weight reduction and thrust optimization are essential. Our unique selling point is a low-cost, ionically propelled aircraft. To achieve this, thin, long elliptical wings were initially considered, resembling those commonly found on gliders:

However, noting that the thrust of the electrohydrodynamic motor performs best over larger surface areas, we are now considering a fixed delta-shaped wing aircraft with a high surface area for the EHD drive. This design leverages vortex lift and additional lift generated by the accelerated neutral particles between the electrodes, similar to FanWing devices. The high maneuverability, stable flight, and structural simplicity of this configuration make it well-suited for prototype development.

To further increase thrust, a ducted motor cell will be placed in the middle of the aircraft, with a converging nozzle at the trailing edge to increase wind speed and momentum of the expelled air.

Further improvements to the design and CFD analysis are needed and will be conducted in the coming days.

The name "Blanket Line" was chosen for the aircraft due to its resemblance to a "mantarraya" (manta ray). Through a play on words, "mantarraya" translates metaphorically to "Blanket Line." As this is the first prototype, the full aircraft designation is BLX01.


We are currently forming alliances with the Monterrey-based start-up Splace Labs to develop the fixed-wing structure and ensure the electrical components are symmetrically positioned within the wings.

This project is ongoing and in its initial stage. The post will continue to be updated in the portfolio.
