I studied at TecBlue Aviationâ€™s technical school in Aircraft Maintenance, where we learned the fundamentals of various airplane components. These included aerodynamics, avionics, hydraulics and pneumatics, control surfaces, and propulsion systems (both piston and turbine-based).

We also had the opportunity to perform maintenance on different airplanes at 'Aeropuerto Internacional del Norte,' a private airport currently serving as a military base.

The following presentation highlights the aircraft that underwent maintenance at the airport as well as other practices.
