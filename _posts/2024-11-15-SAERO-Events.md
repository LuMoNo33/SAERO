As the president of the Aerospace Society (SAERO), a team comprised of over 50 members, I am responsible for leading engineering projects such as the EHD-propelled plane, showcased in the [BLX01 Project]({{ site.baseurl }}/engineering project/BLX01), and co-leading the experimental rocketry team preparing to compete at IREC 2025. More details about our work can be found on the [SRAD Rocket Motor]({{ site.baseurl }}/engineering project/MRL/) page.


In addition, I oversee the organization of on-campus events and company visits.


Memories from these events are highlighted below:

We organized our congress, Altitude, which reached an audience of over 200 participants, including high school students, college students, and professionals. In collaboration with the Monterrey Aerocluster, we created a platform for experts in the aerospace sector to discuss topics such as innovation in the Mexican space industry, women leaders in the field, the impact of companies like Frisa, Bell, and Viva Aerobus, the start-up ecosystem in Mexico, and the future of aviation.

In addition, we have hosted competitions such as Mission Mars, where participants, working in teams of three, were given 24 hours to present innovative proposals in areas such as propulsion, communication, or life support systems for a Mars mission. I am especially proud of bringing together such passionate individuals, including the judges—experts in their fields ranging from CEOs developing Mexican suborbital rockets to doctors researching advancements in DNA and biotechnology—and the enthusiastic participants.

The winning team proposed the use of the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum to develop a biogel capable of reducing radiation intensity, exemplifying creative and practical problem-solving in the context of space exploration.

We have also hosted panels with industry experts, featuring distinguished guests such as Ulises Chavez from Blue Origin, Dr. Paulo Lozano from the MIT Space Propulsion Laboratory, and Fernando Mier-Hicks, currently working at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). These speakers shared their personal stories and career paths, as well as their insights on critical topics, including climate change, Mexican policy reforms, space colonization, and much more.

This semester, we plan to offer multi-day rocketry workshops where participants will build their own rockets. No prior knowledge is required, as the workshops will provide all necessary guidance and equipment, supported by the institution's laboratories. After customizing their rockets and using pre-purchased motors, we will travel to Marte, Coahuila, where we have permits to launch and successfully recover them. This activity will allow participants to obtain their Tripoli Level 1 (L1) certification.

Additionally, we will host competitions similar to Mission Mars, now in collaboration with feminist groups from Tecnológico de Monterrey. To encourage diversity and inclusion, participation will require teams of three to be mixed-gender, including at least one man and one woman. The goal is to inspire and empower women in science, particularly in the aerospace field.
