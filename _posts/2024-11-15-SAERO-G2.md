In previous years, Tec de Monterrey and other international educational institutions established an agreement to offer a dual-degree program in Aerospace Engineering for Tec students. I personally spoke with Ulises Chavez, who is currently directing the avionics routed systems for the New Glenn at Blue Origin. He earned a B.S. in Engineering Physics from Tec de Monterrey and, as part of the agreement, completed a Master’s in Aerospace Engineering at EPF Engineering School in France in 2005.

Seeking to reinstate these opportunities, which Tec has stopped offering, we reached out to several directors within the School of Science and Engineering. However, a lack of interest in reviving these agreements was evident.
Before moving forward, we conducted a preliminary survey to gauge student interest in enrolling in the dual-degree program in Aerospace Engineering.


We received 156 responses, of which:
- 40.4% were from students in Engineering Physics
- 22.4% in Mechanical Engineering
- 20.6% in Mechatronics Engineering. 

The remaining 16.6% came from a variety of other engineering programs.

The current Tec 21 curriculum allows students to dedicate their 7th semester to one of the following options:
- Study Abroad
- Participate in a Research Stay
- Complete an Internship


The proposal is to utilize this semester—and up to a full year—to study Aerospace Engineering at another university offering this program. Students would then return to Tec de Monterrey to complete their studies and graduate with both diplomas.



With the support of the Director of the Engineering Physics Program: Dr. Claudia Bautista, we prepared a formal document to present to senior leadership. This document aimed to highlight the relevance and impact that the dual-degree program could offer. The original document in Spanish is provided below:

To further support our initiative, we collected physical signatures from students at the institution’s facilities.

In the end, we collected a total of 1,082 signatures from engineering students expressing their interest in the creation of the dual-degree program:

By handling and presenting these documents to Tec de Monterrey's senior leadership within the School of Science and Engineering, negotiations have begun with various international universities to create a dual-degree opportunity in Aerospace Engineering.

Although I have been informed that the process is lengthy and may take months or even years to finalize, I understand that I will not be able to obtain the dual degree during my 7th semester. However, I am proud to have contributed to the creation of this program, ensuring that future students passionate about space and flight can benefit from this opportunity
