A few years ago, when I arrived in Monterrey, I joined the team of Techo, a non-governmental organization dedicated to eradicating poverty. As part of this group of young volunteers, I’ve had the opportunity to visit underserved communities many times.

My first activity with Techo was installing thermal insulation in the homes built by the organization. Since then, I have regularly returned to these communities to work with children through the School Strengthening Program (PFE). In this program, I have taught young children to read and provided lessons in mathematics. Occasionally, I enjoy incorporating simplified explanations of complex topics—like black holes, electricity, or light—to spark their curiosity and help them develop a love for science.

Beyond the PFE, I’ve also participated in multiple housing construction projects and community events. A notable example is the massive construction project in Coyuca de Benítez, Guerrero, where we provided support to families affected by Hurricane Otis.

In the following presentation, you’ll find photos and memories of the wonderful experiences I’ve had as part of Techo’s team.
