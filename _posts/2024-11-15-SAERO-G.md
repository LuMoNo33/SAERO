As the president of the Aerospace Society (SAERO), a team comprised of over 50 members, I am responsible for leading engineering projects such as the EHD-propelled plane, showcased in the [BLX01 Project]({{ site.baseurl }}/engineering project/BLX01), and co-leading the experimental rocketry team preparing to compete at IREC 2025. More details about our work can be found on the [SRAD Rocket Motor]({{ site.baseurl }}/engineering project/MRL/) page.


In addition, I oversee the organization of on-campus events and company visits.


Memories from these visits are highlighted below:

We have successfully arranged tours for students and professionals to various industry-leading facilities. These include Viva Aerobus (a leading Mexican airline), Frisa Aerospace (a manufacturing company producing components for SpaceX's Raptor, ULA systems, and Aerojet Rocketdyne engines), hangars at the "Aeropuerto Internacional del Norte," and research facilities such as the CIIIA (Research and Innovation Center in Aeronautical Engineering) of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León.

I have personally led multiple visits to Viva Aerobus, ensuring safe travel and maintaining professional behavior among the visiting students. 

We are currently organizing international visits to prominent aerospace leaders in Texas, including Rolls-Royce, SpaceX’s Starbase, Firefly Aerospace, and NASA
