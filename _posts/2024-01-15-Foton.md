During the winter vacation period, my friend Cristopher and I worked full-time at a Foton Truck Dealership in Mexico as maintenance technicians.

Both of us had prior experience as mechanics during high school, which gave us familiarity with tools. However, this was the first time we were entrusted with full responsibilities for repairs and worked independently to complete them.

We developed a deeper understanding of the mechanical systems within trucks and performed routine service operations, such as checking fluid levels, draining and refilling fluids, inspecting brake pads, discs, or drums, replacing damaged parts, and ensuring the overall health of the vehicles. Additionally, we handled more complex repairs, including the disassembly, damage evaluation, repair, and reassembly of gasoline engines, manual and semi-automatic transmissions, and pneumatic systems.

A highlight of this experience was the opportunity to work on the repair and connection of a fully electric truck.
